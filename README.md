Welcome to the **Rainfall Prediction App**! This project predicts the **monthly sum of rainfall** based on meteorological data such as Specific Humidity, Relative Humidity, and Temperature. The app is built using **Streamlit** and powered by a **Random Forest Regressor** model trained on data from NASA's POWER project.

## **Overview**
This project aims to predict the **monthly sum of rainfall** using meteorological data. The app takes user inputs for **Specific Humidity**, **Relative Humidity**, and **Temperature** and provides a prediction for the total rainfall expected in a month. The prediction is based on a **Random Forest Regressor** model trained on historical climate data.

## **Model Details**
### **Algorithms Tested**
Three machine learning models were evaluated for this project:
1. **Linear Regression**
2. **Random Forest Regressor**
3. **XGBoost Regressor**

### **Model Performance**
| Model                  | RMSE                     | R¬≤ Score                 |
|------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| Linear Regression      | 193.23906389559792       | 0.5901603563614706       |
| Random Forest Regressor| 120.15854738896871       | 0.8415349637940618       |
| XGBoost Regressor      | 154.60391662615186       | 0.7376596467775496       |

The **Random Forest Regressor** was selected as the final model due to its superior performance (lowest RMSE and highest R¬≤ score).

### **Features**
- **Specific Humidity** (g/kg)
- **Relative Humidity** (%)
- **Temperature** (¬∞C)

### **Target Variable**
- **Precipitation**: The monthly sum of rainfall (in mm).

---

## **Dataset**
The dataset is sourced from NASA's **Prediction of Worldwide Energy Resources (POWER)** project. It includes monthly meteorological data for Mumbai, India, from **2000 to 2020**. The dataset contains the following variables:
- **Specific Humidity** (g/kg)
- **Relative Humidity** (%)
- **Temperature** (¬∞C)
- **Precipitation** (monthly sum of rainfall in mm)

### **Statistical Summary**
| Feature           | Count  | Mean     | Std      | Min   | 25%    | 50%    | 75%    | Max     |
|-------------------|--------|----------|----------|-------|--------|--------|--------|---------|
| Specific Humidity | 252    | 14.42    | 4.38     | 5.74  | 10.01  | 15.20  | 18.88  | 20.57   |
| Relative Humidity | 252    | 67.26    | 17.31    | 34.69 | 51.85  | 66.66  | 84.61  | 92.31   |
| Temperature       | 252    | 16.32    | 6.58     | 4.73  | 10.87  | 16.92  | 22.12  | 29.34   |
| Precipitation     | 252    | 206.80   | 318.09   | 0.00  | 0.40   | 11.50  | 353.20 | 1307.43 |

## **Installation**
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Aakash109-hub/Rainfall_Prediction.git
   cd Rainfall_Prediction
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## **Usage**
1. **Run the Streamlit app**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. **Input Features**:
